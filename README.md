## Customization

The easiest customization is swapping out the `background.webp` image.

The weather is based on my location in Morganton, NC so if you want somewhere
else swap out the AccuWeather link in `newtab.js`. My location looks like this:

    https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/morganton/28655/weather-forecast/334823

You can just search for your location on the AccuWeather website and copy the
url of the resulting page.
