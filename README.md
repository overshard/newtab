# New Tab

A clean tab page made by Isaac Bythewood, you can grab it and customize it
yourself at [https://github.com/overshard/newtab](https://github.com/overshard/newtab).


## Installation

Download the files from GitHub or clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/overshard/newtab.git

Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in you browser and enable
`Developer mode` in the top right. Then click `Load unpacked` and select the
folder your just cloned or downloaded.


## Customization

The easiest customization is swapping out the `background.webp` image. The
weather is based on my location in Morganton, NC so if you want somewhere else
swap out the AccuWeather link in `newtab.js`. My location looks like this:
